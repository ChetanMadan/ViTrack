# Title 

Vi-Track 

# Description 

Vi-Track provides a way for people whose relatives are affected by the pandemic to check and monitor the health and status of the infected patient. This would be extremely helpful for people as confirmed COVID 19 patients are kept in complete isolation and are not allowed to have visitors throughout their course of treatment. The setup consists of a hardware module equipped with sensors that read the vital signs of the patient and send the data to an online server. The data can be viewed and accessed through this web application by family members of the patient, in real-time. To avoid breaching in the privacy of the patients, the user data is deleted after regular time intervals. This web application utilizes a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to read the data and detect any anomalies to notify the appropriate parties in case the patient's health starts to deteriorate abruptly.
